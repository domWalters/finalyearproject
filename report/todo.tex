* Shan said something about using a simulator to create "realistic" seeming data, that has complex multivariable dependencies on price. This would allow for extremely thorough testing of the system with data that guarantees a relationship to be observed. This would be used in place of toy data (vectors full of noise with 1 variable contributing linearly to price).

* Finish lit review.

* Read turing

* Do testing

* Get data every day.

* Investigate data contraction after analytical vector is produced.
